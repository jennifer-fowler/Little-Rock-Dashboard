# Little-Rock-Dashboard

This is a Shiny R application that I developed for a project in Information Visualization using publicly available data from the City of Little Rock. 

The dashboard has two pages- the first is a map with layers for various places of interest in Little Rock and clustered violent offenses. 
The second tab has some charts that visualize various city data such as home prices, crime rates over time, wage comparisons, and business licenses.
